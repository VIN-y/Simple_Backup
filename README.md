There are some missing features that is currently being worked on:
1. Progress bar - the most tricky part is where to put it (aestheticly speaking).
2. Auto backup - Create a scheduled task, which can be change by the user.

Here are features that I though about, but still don't know if they are worth it (or simply have not figured out how to do yet):
1. Trusted Publisher Certificate - this would allow the app to not be seen as untrusted source source on first start. However, it is a paid feature for myself and I am not ready to commit to that yet.
2. Local installation (into the "./Program File" folder) - the app itself would required very little changes for this to happen. The problem is one again the "Trusted Publisher Certificate"
3. Encryption - encrypt the drive itself, so any system (different computer and OS) would need to put in a password to get the data from the drive. I just have not figured out how to do this yet.
4. Title bar theme and overall aesthetic - this will a lot of work just for better look. So this will be at the lowest priority.
